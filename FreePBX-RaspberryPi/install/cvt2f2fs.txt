The cvt2f2fs script will convert a Raspian ext4 filesystem on an SD card to F2FS.

!!! MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF THE SD CARD BEFORE ATTEMPTING THIS PROCEDURE !!!

1. Disconnect all USB devices from the Raspberry Pi.

2. Connect a USB flash drive with sufficient capacity to hold the SD card contents.
   !!! ALL EXISTING DATA ON THE USB FLASH DRIVE WILL BE DESTROYED !!!

3. Log in as root

4. Run ./cvt2f2fs

5. Log in as root following the reboots which occur at the completion of Phases 1, 2, and 3

6. When Phase 4 completes, the SD card should be using an F2FS filesystem instead of ext4
