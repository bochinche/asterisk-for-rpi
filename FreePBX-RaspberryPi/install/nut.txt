Network UPS Tools (NUT) is a package for monitoring an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)
and performing an orderly shutdown of one or more computers should the UPS battery
approach depletion during a power outage.

NUT can be installed as a Server or a Client.
A NUT Server is used on the computer to which the UPS is connected via USB.
A NUT Client is used on a computer connected to the same network as the NUT Server.
